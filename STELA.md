## The Happy Times (Her True Spirit)

Three weeks before she left us, Stela was still playful and cheerful:

- Watching birds and squirrels through the window with intense focus
- Sitting by the fireplace, enjoying the warmth
- Playing with Christmas tree ornaments
- Delighting in wrapping paper - pouncing, hiding, playing
- Wathching birds and squirrels on deck eating peanuts
- Her gentle, loving nature

These are the memories that capture who she really was.

## Her Final Fight (Private Memory)

**Duration**: ~68 hours on oxygen  
**January 21-23, 2026**

### What She Endured

- Heavy breathing, fighting for each breath
- Eyes half-open most of the time (couldn't fully rest)
- Oxygen mask - uncomfortable position, but she dilegently keep using it
- Since she couldn't talk, it was hard to know how to help or adjust the mask
- She kept trying, kept fighting

### How We Cared for Her

The three of us (me, my wife, and our daughter) took turns:

- Watching over her constantly
- Wetting her lips to keep them moist
- Offering water frequently, using a syringe to help her drink
- Give her favorite food
- Administering medicine
- Staying with her and helping with the oxygen mask

### The Truth

She fought so hard. She deserved more years of happiness - more birds to watch, more fireplace warmth, more Christmas trees, more simple joys.

## Why This App Exists

Stela taught us what matters:

- Presence over productivity
- Simple joys over complex achievements
- Nature and quiet moments over busy stress
- Love and companionship

Way Finder exists to help us remember these lessons and live them.

Not to track tasks and streaks.  
Not to add stress and pressure.  
But to help us focus on what she would have wanted us to focus on:  
**The simple, beautiful, meaningful moments.**

## The Promise

To honor Stela's memory by:

- Appreciating simple pleasures (like she did with birds and squirrels)
- Being present (like she was with us)
- Fighting for what matters (like she fought to stay)
- Living fully (like she deserved more time to do)

Way Finder helps us do this - gently, like Stela herself.

**January 23, 2026**  
She was brave. She fought hard. She deserved more.  
We will remember the joy, not just the pain.
