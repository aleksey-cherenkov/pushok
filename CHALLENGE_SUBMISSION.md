# Way Finder - Fighting Resistance, One Habit at a Time

_Submission for the [GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/github-2026-01-21)_

> **The Real Story:** I _could_ build this. I've done full-stack before (IIS, Apache, C++/CGI, the works). But I didn't. For the past 15 years, I was mostly backend C# dev. I would not touch frontend because I knew how much imperfect my solution would be. I couldn't—because of perfectionism, self-doubt, procrastination. **Resistance.**
>
> Then GitHub Copilot CLI gave me permission to be imperfect. To not understand everything completely before starting. To just... ship.
>
> **2 weeks later:** First React app deployed. Event sourcing. AI integration. Custom domain. Not perfect. But real.
>
> **This is the power of Copilot CLI:** It doesn't just teach—it gets you unstuck.

## What I Built

**Way Finder** (codename: Pushok) - fights the same Resistance I faced while building it.

No broken streaks. No guilt. Just "you showed up 18 times this month" and that's enough.

Named after my cat Stela (Pushistik, Pushok): sunshine, nature, presence, love. Simple joys.

### The Problem (In Apps and In Me)

Productivity apps create Resistance:

- "You broke your streak!" → Self-doubt
- "You missed 3 days!" → Perfectionism (all or nothing)
- Constant pressure → Procrastination (I'll start when I feel ready)

**Resistance wins. You quit.**

### The Solution

**Aggregation, not streaks:**

- 🌿 "18 walks this month" (not "missed 12 days")
- ✨ Volume over consistency (10 → 50 → 100)
- 📊 Multiple logs per day ("3 sessions • 75 pushups")
- ❌ No breaking, just continuing

**Event Sourcing** makes it work:

- Every action = immutable event
- Aggregations show progress without guilt
- No streak metadata to "break"

**AI helps you start:**

- "Do 50 pushups daily" → Configured habit
- GPT-5-nano (~$1/month not $20)

**Working now:**

- AI-assisted habit creation
- Multiple logs per day with values
- Aggregated totals ("3 sessions • 45 min")
- Timeline view

## The Real Copilot CLI Story

### My Background

Full-stack experience:

- 10+ years backend (C#, migrations, ETL)
- Deployed IIS, Apache, C++/CGI manually
- Built complete systems before

**But for 7 months:** Nothing.

**Not because I couldn't. Because of Resistance:**

- Perfectionism: "I need to understand React completely first"
- Self-doubt: "Real devs don't struggle like this"
- Procrastination: "I'll start when I feel ready"

**Steven Pressfield nailed it in "The War of Art":** _"Resistance is the enemy of creativity. It shows up as procrastination, self-doubt, perfectionism, fear."_

### What Copilot CLI Did

**Not teach me React** (I could Bing that).

**Got me unstuck:**

### What Copilot CLI Did

**Not teach me React** (I could Bing that).

**Got me unstuck:**

1. **Gave permission to start imperfectly**
   - "Just ask questions as you go"
   - Don't need to understand everything first
   - Ship now, learn while building

2. **Answered without judgment**
   - "How does React hooks compare to C# patterns?"
   - No "you should already know this"
   - Explained in terms I understood

3. **Made decisions when I overthought**
   - "Static export vs SSR?" → Here's why SSR
   - "Which AI model?" → GPT-5-nano, here's why
   - Stopped analysis paralysis

4. **Kept me moving**
   - "Network config error" → Fixed in minutes
   - "How to deploy?" → Step-by-step
   - No Stack Overflow rabbit holes

**Result:** 2 weeks from nothing to shipped. Not perfect. But real.

**The meta-irony:** Built app to fight Resistance while Copilot CLI helped me fight Resistance building it.

### The Honest Truth

**I don't call this "professional"** because:

- I didn't verify everything completely
- I didn't understand every detail perfectly
- I shipped before I felt "ready"

**And that's exactly the point.**

Perfectionism is Resistance. Self-doubt is Resistance. Waiting to "be ready" is Resistance.

**Copilot CLI gave me permission to be good enough and ship anyway.**

### What I Actually Shipped

First React app with:

- Event sourcing (events as truth, aggregations for views)
- Azure OpenAI integration (GPT-5-nano)
- Next.js 16 (SSR, not static export)
- Custom domain (pushok.life)
- Docs (wrote as I built, 3,100+ lines)

**Stack I learned while building:**

- React/Next.js 16
- TypeScript (knew C# types, adapted)
- Dexie.js for IndexedDB
- Tailwind CSS
- Azure Static Web Apps

### The Game-Changers

**🎯 Cost Optimization**

```
Me: "Best AI model?"
Copilot: "GPT-4o-mini"

Me: "What about GPT-5-nano?"
Copilot: "Exists! 67% cheaper, 90% caching"
```

**Saved $180/year. One question.**

**🌐 Avoiding Dead-Ends**

```
Me: "Static export vs SSR?"
Copilot: "SSR. You need API routes for AI."
```

**Would've wasted days realizing this.**

**🎨 Design Through Conversation**

```
Me: "Cats wake up, play... humans have chores..."
Copilot: "3-layer system: Aspirations → Habits → Actions"
```

**Turned rambling into architecture.**

## What This Means

### If You Have Imposter Syndrome

I have 10+ years experience. Still got stuck by:

- "I need to understand this perfectly first"
- "Real devs don't ask basic questions"
- "I should know this already"

**Copilot CLI doesn't judge.** Just answers.

That permission to ask "dumb" questions? Gold.

### If You're Procrastinating

Traditional approach:

- Research for weeks
- Plan perfectly
- Never start (not ready yet)

With Copilot CLI:

- Ask questions as you go
- Make decisions quickly
- Ship imperfectly

**2 weeks vs never.** That's the difference.

### The Numbers

**Time:** Would've procrastinated for months (or never started). Shipped in 2 weeks.

**Cost:** $180/year saved by asking one question about AI models.

**Docs:** 3,100+ lines written as I built (not as afterthought).

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (SSR, Turbopack)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- IndexedDB (Dexie.js)
- Azure OpenAI (GPT-5-nano)
- Azure Static Web Apps (Free)
- Custom domain: pushok.life

**Budget:** $1-5/month

---

## What's Next

Building the Resistance-fighting features:

- Aspirations ("Get stronger for hiking")
- Progress visualization (not guilt)
- "Overcame Resistance" tracking
- Milestones that celebrate volume

Then: Demo video

## The Bottom Line

**Copilot CLI isn't about speed.** It's about unsticking.

Experienced dev → Blocked by perfectionism/self-doubt → Got moving with Copilot CLI → Shipped in 2 weeks.

**The app fights Resistance. Copilot CLI helped me fight Resistance to build it.**

**This is what "AI-assisted development" really means.**
